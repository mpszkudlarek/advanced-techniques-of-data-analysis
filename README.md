# Advanced Data Analysis Techniques - Coursework

This repository contains the coursework submissions for the Advanced Data Analysis Techniques course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. The coursework is composed of 10 problem sets and a comprehensive project, all of which are implemented in Python and utilize the Weka GUI for certain tasks.

### Problem Sets Overview:
- **Problem Set 2:** Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- **Problem Set 3:** Tests for Normality Distribution, including Shapiro-Wilk (S-W), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S), and Lilliefors (K-S-L)
- **Problem Set 4:** T-Tests for dependent and independent samples, and for a single sample
- **Problem Set 5:** Nonparametric Tests for Dependent Samples, including:
    - Sign Test
    - Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
    - McNemar's Test
- **Problem Set 6:** Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis, and Friedman Tests
- **Problem Set 7:** Preliminary Data Preparation
- **Problem Set 8:** Data Processing Using Weka GUI
- **Problem Set 9:** Feature Selection from Data
- **Problem Set 10:** Data Classification

### Course Project:
The course project involves analyzing the volume of Python-related queries on Stack Overflow over three distinct time periods:
- From 2008-12-01 to 2013-12-01
- From 2014-01-01 to 2019-01-01
